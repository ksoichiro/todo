# TODO (WIP)

To Do management web application written in many languages and frameworks.

The main purpose of this project is to understand how to write basic web application in each languages/frameworks and compare them.

In each directory (languages/frameworks), web applications are implemented with the same specification.

I'm not going to say any opinions for each languages/frameworks, because this web application (specification) is not always suitable for judging which is better or the best.

Please watch it warmly, because actually I'm new to almost all of the frameworks :smile:
